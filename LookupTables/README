This directory contains the "standard" lookup tables for CRASH and some
input files that can be included into the PARAM.in file.
The default lookup tables were created with the Param/CRASH/TABLE*.in
include files.

One can generate custom CRASH lookup tables by running the CRASH code
and using the appropriate #LOOKUPTABLE commands.

Some useful lookup tables are stored in the LookupTables directory 
on the CRASH disk on nyx (/nfs/crash_ls/) also mounted on herot (/crash_disk)
